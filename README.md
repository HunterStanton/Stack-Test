# Stack-Test
I made this so I could help understand the LIFO stack in a Swift data type sense. It just allows you to pop random numbers onto and off the stack, and print the current contents of the stack.

The Stack class comes from https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/blob/master/Stack/Stack.swift. All credits to the original authors. I just added documentation to it.
